# Grails Cookie Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stokito/grails-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stokito/grails-cookie)

This plugin makes dealing with cookies easy. Provides an injectable service and tag to easily get, set, and delete cookies with one line.

It's [RFC 6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) compliant.

## Installation

To install the cookie plug-in just add to `BuildConfig.groovy`:
```groovy
compile ':cookie:1.4'
```

## Configuration

You can configure in `Config.groovy` how long the default cookie age will be (in seconds) when not explicitly supplied while setting a cookie.
```groovy
grails.plugins.cookie.cookieage.default = 86400 // if not specified default in code is 30 days
```

## Usage

You have two ways to work with cookies:
* The cookie plug-in extends the `request` and `response` objects found in controllers, filters, etc to allow the following.
* The cookie plug-in provides a [CookieService](./grails-app/services/grails/plugin/cookie/CookieService.groovy) that can be used anywhere in your Grails application.

Example of setting a new cookie:
```groovy
// This sets a cookie with the name `username` to the value `cookieUser123` with a expiration set to a week, defined in seconds
response.setCookie('username', 'cookieUser123', 604800)
// will use default age from Config (or 30 days if not defined)
response.setCookie('username', 'cookieUser123')

// using service
def cookieService // define field for DI
...
cookieService.setCookie('username', 'cookieUser123', 604800)
```

To get the cookie value:
```groovy
request.getCookie('username') // returns 'cookieUser123'

// using service
def cookieService // define field for DI
...
cookieService.getCookie('username') // returns 'cookieUser123'
```

To delete the cookie (actually it set new expired cookie with same name):
```groovy
response.deleteCookie('username') // deletes the 'username' cookie
// using service
def cookieService // define field for DI
...
cookieService.deleteCookie('username')
```

All this methods has other signatures and you can find all of them in [CookieService](./grails-app/services/grails/plugin/cookie/CookieService.groovy) JavaDoc's.

You can check out [Demo project](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie-demo) and also you can find details of implementation in [CookieRequestSpec](./src/test/groovy/grails/plugin/cookie/CookieRequestSpec.groovy) and [CookieResponseSpec](./src/test/groovy/grails/plugin/cookie/CookieResponseSpec.groovy).

## Configuration

You can configure default values of attributes in `Config.groovy`.

### Default Max Age
Default expiration age for cookie in seconds. `Max-Age` attribute, integer.

If it has value `-1` cookie will not stored and removed after browser close.

If it has null value or unset, will be used 30 days, i.e. `2592000` seconds.

Can't has value `0`, because it means that cookie should be removed.

```groovy
grails.plugins.cookie.cookieage.default = 360 * 24 * 60 * 60
```

### Default Path
Default path for cookie selection strategy, string.
* 'context' - web app context path, i.e. `grails.app.context` option in `Config.groovy`
* 'root' - root of server, i.e. '/'
* 'current' - current directory, i.e. controller name

If default path is null or unset, it will be used 'context' strategy

```groovy
grails.plugins.cookie.path.defaultStrategy = 'context'
```

### Default Secure
Default secure cookie param. Secure cookie available only for HTTPS connections. `Secure` attribute, boolean.
If default secure is null or unset, it will set all new cookies as secure if current connection is secure
```groovy
grails.plugins.cookie.secure.default = null
```

### Default HTTP Only
Default HTTP Only param that denies accessing to JavaScript's `document.cookie`.

If null or unset will be `true`

```groovy
grails.plugins.cookie.httpOnly.default = true
```

You can find details of implementation in [CookieServiceDefaultsSpec](./src/test/groovy/grails/plugin/cookie/CookieServiceDefaultsSpec.groovy).

### External Config
If you use property files to inject values to plugins at runtime.  This is now supported as of version 1.0.2.  This means that inside your external `foo.properties` file you can specify the following.

```groovy
grails.plugins.cookie.httpOnly.default=true
```

The string value will correctly be treated as a boolean.

## Changelog

[All releases](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/releases)

### v1.4 For Grails 2.4
[Source](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/releases/tag/v1.4)

- Minimal Grails version 2.4

### v1.2 Fixed bug with `path.defaultStrategy` option
[Source](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/releases/tag/v1.2)

- [#35](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/35) option `grails.plugins.cookie.path.defaultStrategy` doesn't work.
- Minimal Grails version 2.2.0. But tests of plugin itself will failed. To run them use command `./grailsw test-app` that uses wrapper with Grails 2.4
- Minimal Java version is downgraded to 6

### v1.1.0 Fixed bug with defaults not configured in Config
[Source](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

- Minimal Grails version 2.4.0. Plugin probably should work with early versions of Grails but init tests require v2.4.0
- [#32](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/32) Add ability to externalize configuration by changing check for boolean from `instanceof Boolean` to `toBoolean()` which will correctly address boolean `false` and string `"false"` properties

### v1.0.1 Fixed bug with defaults not configured in Config
[Source](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

- [#30](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/30) Default path strategy is 'context' and `grails.app.context` used null instead of actual context

### v1.0 Production ready version

- [#17](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/17) Since v0.1 all deprecated things was removed:
       * Tag `<cookie:get/>`. Use standard `<g:cookie/>` tag instead.
       * Methods `get()`, `set()`, `delete()` from `CookieService`. They are replaced with corresponding `getCookie()`,  `setCookie()`, `deleteCookie()`.
- [#19](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/19) All cookies should be Version 1 (by RFC 2109) cookie specifications

- [#10](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/10) Improved delete cookie method.  Method delete cookie now can takes a domain name
- [#28](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/28) `setCookie()` and `deleteCookie()` should return added cookie
- [#25](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/25) Make default `path`, `secure` and `httpOnly` configurable and more intelligent  enhancement


### v0.60 Last release with deprecated taglib and methods in service
[Source](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/releases/tag/v0.6)

- [#3](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/3) Fixed `deleteCookie` not works in `response`
- [#16](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/16) added tests
- [#17](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/issues/17) Since v0.5 few things was deprecated and will be removed in version v1.0:
       * Tag `<cookie:get/>`. Use standard `<g:cookie/>` tag instead.
       * Methods `get()`, `set()`, `delete()` from `CookieService`. They are replaced with corresponding `getCookie()`,  `setCookie()`, `deleteCookie()`.

### v0.3
[Source](https://github.com/stokito/grails-cookie/releases/tag/v0.3)

In the v0.3 release a big issue was fixed that now sets the cookie's path to the root `/` context.
Otherwise it was setting the path to the same as the controller/service that triggered it.
Most users I believe will want this behavior. If setting the path is desired, that can be accommodated.
Please contact me or do a pull request if you'd like that.
